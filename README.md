# Tiny_ECC
Lightweight C implementations of short error correcting codes

Currently includes encoding for Reed-Solomon over GF(8) and GF(16).
Decoding not yet implemented.
May later add Binary Golay encoding and Decoding and Hamming if I ever get around to it.

## Reason for writing
I needed some very small block length error correcting codes but couldn't find any existing open source ones that fit my needs so I decided I'd learn how it worked and do it myself.
